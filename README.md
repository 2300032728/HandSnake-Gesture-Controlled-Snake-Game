# 🐍 HandSnake: Gesture-Controlled Snake Game 🎮🖐️

HandSnake is a modern twist on the classic Snake game — but with no keyboard or joystick.  
Instead, **you control the snake with your finger movements** using a webcam and real-time hand tracking.  
Powered by **OpenCV**, **cvzone**, and **MediaPipe**, it blends nostalgia with futuristic interaction.
